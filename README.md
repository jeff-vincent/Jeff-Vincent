### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a technical writer for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and I'm passionate about developer advocacy ðŸ¥‘
- You can chat with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-v-28b588152/) and check out [my Medium posts](https://medium.com/@jeff.d.vincent) to see examples of my developer content.

- Some open source example applications I'm particularly proud of are:
  - A [GPT-2 fine tuning and deployment example](https://github.com/jeff-vincent/velocity-gpt2-eks-example) built specifically to run in AWS EKS.
  - An [async microservice networking example written in Go](https://github.com/jeff-vincent/go-gin-redis-mongodb).
